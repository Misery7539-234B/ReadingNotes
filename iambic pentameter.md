### Lost One's Weeping

The chalked equations fade on dusty boards,  
While jobless winds blow through the lecture halls -  
Our majors bloom like flowers without bees,  
Their pollen wasted where no commerce calls.

Glass towers burn with midnight's captive fire,  
Their flickering screens mock degrees framed in dust.  
The rent's cold hand grows tighter every moon,  
While ramen boils where banquets turned to rust.

Thick tomes of hope pile high by trembling lamps,  
Each page a stepping stone to cliffs unseen.  
The job fair's circus spins its gilded lies -  
"Come, trained seals, jump through hoops of evergreen!"

Black coffee stains the resumes we revise,  
Each semicolon bleeding wasted years.  
Our syllabi, pale ghosts of market's want,  
Dissolve like ink beneath December's tears.

Yet in this weeping, secret strengths take root -  
The willow bends where oaks in storms may break.  
We'll graft new skills to academe's dead wood,  
And forge our paths where no blueprints awake.

### Canary
A scarecrow’s bones beneath the silk she wears,  
Her palms still cracked from reaping autumn’s scorn—  
The princess gifts sweet figs to purge the stains  
Of mud-streaked hymns that peasant dawns had borne.

_“Illiterate fields birthed you,”_ croons the crown,  
_“Let my tongue be your scripture, love, take root.”_  
By day, state ink consumes her weathered brow;  
By night, she kneads the alphabet from fruit.

Their bed—a threshing floor where letters rise  
Like wheat once cut by hands now gilt in chains.  
The canary’s cage was forged from unplowed skies,  
Its bars the quill that rewrites childhood’s rains.

Oh, love devours what it claims to bless:  
Silk chokes the chaff, starved songbirds chew their dress.

---

Within the tower’s cold and stony grasp,  
She wears the gowns of silk her princess chose—  
Sweet figs and wine, a feast to gently clasp  
The canary’s throat where no true freedom flows.

_“The world beyond is wolves,”_ the crown declares,  
_“Stay nested here, beloved, in my care.”_  
By day, she rules; by dusk, she climbs the stairs  
To find her love asleep in lamplit hair.

They kiss as ink bleeds through the kingdom’s scrolls,  
Her wings clipped soft by hands that swear to shield.  
Yet pages turn where restless longing rolls—  
A hymn of storms in books she’s sworn to yield.

Oh, love may crown the cage with gilded lies,  
But canaries starve on whispered lullabies.

---
Child of clay with wheat-stemmed throat confined,  
Thorn-soul grafted with royal rose's breath—  
Fingers trace psalms in moon-bleached vellum's bind,  
Where ink births orchids from her blood's dark depth.

Their bed: winepress where crushed pomegranates weep,  
Peach-flesh alphabets stain parchment of thighs,  
Peasant rust blooms through tapestry's stone keep,  
While walls drink moans from honeycombed lies.

Dawn spins law-threads through the regent's bleached loom,  
As syllables ferment in porcelain womb—  
Twilight braids their shadows into live vines,  
Harvesting echoes from scarred colonnades.

When snow chokes bells, her mirror-song still climbs:  
Root-knotted tongue unravels thyme-steeped rhymes.

### "The Siege of Mana Manor"

In Mana’s moldered manor, midnight’s maw aglow,  
Rozwood ransacked relic tomes, their runes wrought long ago.  
Bound in beastial bones, a blackened book he stole—  
Its parchment pulsed with power to possess a pitiless soul.

Chalked circles crackled, candles carved with cursed chants,  
He sliced his stainless scepter, summoning swine and slavering hounds.  
Through throats of thunder, tri-star horns resound—  
Two-ton terrors tore from earth, their tusks like twilight crowned.

Bristling beasts, blades of bone bared to bleed,  
Tusks twirled twisted thunder—townsfolk trembled, turned to seed.  
Roofs ripped, rivers ran with rubble, rage unrolled—  
Rozwood roared, rancid rapture rippling through his soul.

Villages vanished, veils of vaporized despair,  
Hovels hammered into husk, hollowed by the horde’s foul air.  
Screams swirled like smoke—slaughtered, scattered, shred to bone—  
As Mana’s moon wept mute, on madness mercilessly sown.

Reinhart’s stallion shattered, screamed as swine struck swift—  
Tusks tore its throat, steel-tusked throats consumed the thrashing gift.  
Hooves hammered flesh to pulp, bones cracked like clay,  
While Reinhart reeled, wrathful, in the reeking fray.

Shuma chanted, chaos-crowned, her cry a crackling blight—  
Air burst to blood and bone, a blizzard of hog-hide.  
Guts glazed the grass, gore in gruesome rain,  
As boar-bodies blasted skyward, meat and marrow slain.

Rozwood’s mana withered, wrenched by wicked will—  
The hogs, now husks, turned hellish, hunger-driven to kill.  
No reins of rage to rule their rabid tide,  
They gnarled at guild and gallows, masterless in pride.

Rozwood, raving, stumbled—sweat and sorcery spent,  
His crimson cloak a cage, his trembling hands unbent.  
Reinhart roared, wrath relentless, blade a silver storm—  
One arc of aching steel, and bloodied breath grew warm.

The neck split, a nectar-spurt of gore,  
Rozwood’s skull sank slack, his sneer a snarl no more.  
A crownless corpse collapsed, the crows their chorus cried—  
And Mana’s moon rose, mourning where the tyrant died.

Hog-heaps rose, a hill of horrors high,  
Tusks tangled, trunk-less, beneath a smoke-smeared sky.  
Grass grew glutted, ground a gruesome crimson sheet,  
Mud made mortal—man and beast in meat-marsh meet.

Shuma’s seals still smoked where the siege was torn,  
Reinhart knelt, kissed his blade, baptized in bitter dawn.  
While Rozwood’s banner burned, ash where evil once did rend—  
Mana’s meadows mended, malice met its end.

In Mana's old mansion, under midnight's glow,  
Rozwood stole a dark book from long ago.  
Bound in animal bones, its pages burned bright—  
A cursed thing to control souls with might.

Chalk circles sparked, candles lit with chants,  
He cut his staff, summoned pigs and fierce hants.  
Loud horns echoed through the trembling ground—  
Monster boars rose, tusks sharp, making towns drown.

---

Bone-blade beasts made rivers run red,  
Roofs ripped apart, people fled in dread.  
Villages vanished in smoke and despair,  
Homes crushed to dust by beasts in the air.

Reinhart's horse fell, torn by sharp tusks,  
Hooves smashed flesh as Reinhart fought through the dusk.  
Shuma chanted spells, made boars explode—  
Blood rained down as magic took its toll.

Rozwood's power faded, beasts went wild,  
No control left—destruction piled.  
Reinhart swung his sword with furious might—  
Cut Rozwood's throat, ending the dark fight.

Dead boars formed hills under ashy skies,  
Ground soaked red where both man and beast lies.  
Shuma's magic seals still smoked at dawn,  
Mana's fields healed—the evil was gone.
